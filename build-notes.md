## Session Rules

### Code & Documentation Rules (Enforced by Pre-Push Hook)
- **Pre-push hook** at `.githooks/pre-push` blocks any push that changes code files without also updating `CLAUDE.md` and `build-notes.md` in the same commit. Run `npm run setup-hooks` once after cloning.
- **Update both `CLAUDE.md` and `build-notes.md`** in the same commit as any feature or fix — never at end-of-session only.
- **After every commit/push**, give the user the pull command in a copyable code block:
  ```
  git pull origin claude/adoring-shannon-sTxW8
  ```
- **After every change or fix**, provide a brief summary:
  1. What the problem was (or what was requested)
  2. What was changed (files/logic updated)
  3. What to test to confirm it works
- **Phase log format:** newest phase at the top, labeled `### Phase N - Complete`, bullet points only — no sub-headers inside a phase entry.
- **DB table created or column added** → update the Database Tables section in the same commit.
- **Security item built** → mark it ✅ in the Security Status table in the same commit.

### Feature Tracking Rules (Enforced Every Session)
- **Any feature discussed but not built in the same session must be added to Future Features before the conversation ends.** Even a one-liner placeholder is enough. No exceptions. This is what prevents things from falling through the cracks between sessions.
- **At the start of any planning session** ("what should we build?", "what's left?", "let's make a plan") — read the Future Features section before discussing new ideas. Do not re-spec things already captured.
- **When a feature is built**, move its entry from Future Features to the Phase Log. Never leave it in both places.
- **QA items** are removed from the Untested section once the user confirms tested and passing.
- **Future Features status tags:** 💬 Discussed (idea floated, not fully specced) | 📋 Fully Specced (design complete, ready to build) | ⏳ Pending Build (specced and queued, not started)

## Future Features — Planned Design

**Status tags:** 💬 Discussed | 📋 Fully Specced | ⏳ Pending Build

Build order is listed within each section. The overall priority is: Goals Setup expansion → Nutrition intelligence → Stretching & Mobility → remaining Workout improvements.

---

### 🎯 Goals & Body Setup

**1. Age-Specific Framing Copy** — ✅ Partially built (age callouts in Goals Setup step 5); remaining: nutrition page showing age-adjusted targets vs FDA defaults side-by-side
- Under 18: "You're still growing — bone density builds during these years. We've kept your deficit conservative to protect this window." Deficit capped at 300 cal/day for teens.
- 18–25: "Your body is in its peak building window — this is the best time to establish a strong base."
- 25–35: "Your metabolism is beginning a gradual slowdown — the numbers reflect a small adjustment."
- 35–50: "After 35, muscle is harder to maintain — your protein target is slightly higher to compensate."
- 50+: "After 50, protein and calcium needs actually increase. Your targets are higher than the generic FDA averages on purpose."

**2. `gain_weight` Goal Option** — ✅ Built (Phase 51)

**3. Dietary Preferences Wired Downstream** — ✅ Built (Phase 50)

**4. Orphaned Inputs — Wire Up Remaining** — 💬 Discussed / 📋 Partially Specced
| Input | Current use | Planned use |
|---|---|---|
| Biggest obstacles | AI overview only | Workout plan prompt (injury-aware adjustments); nutrition coaching (budget → cheap high-protein suggestions) |
| Primary motivations | AI overview only | Coaching tone on "What Happens Now"; Daily Brief framing |
| Why goals (free text) | AI overview only | Daily Brief personalization |
| Sleep hours | Recovery Score + AI overview | Note when chronically poor (impairs muscle protein synthesis — relevant to protein target) |

### 🍎 Nutrition

**5. Pre/Post Workout Meal Advisor** — ✅ Built (Phase 51)

**10. Supplement Logs Table + Adherence Tracking** — ✅ Built (Phase 51)

---

### 🧘 Stretching & Mobility

**11. Full Stretching & Mobility Section** — 📋 Fully Specced / ⏳ Pending Build
A complete system parallel to Workouts but lighter in logging. No timer, no HR tracking, no sets/reps — just a library, smart recommendations, and simple checkmark logging.

**Key physiological distinction (must be respected throughout):** Dynamic stretches (pre-workout — leg swings, arm circles, hip rotations) warm up joints without reducing force output. Static stretches (30–60 second holds) temporarily reduce muscle force by up to 8% — these go AFTER workouts or in standalone sessions, never before lifting.

**Stretch Library:**
- Categorized by muscle group: Chest, Back, Hips, Hamstrings, Shoulders, Quads, Calves, Neck, Core, Full Body
- Each entry: name, how to do it, what NOT to do (common mistakes), muscles targeted, stretch type (dynamic/static/both), recommended duration, contraindications (e.g. "avoid if you have herniated disc")
- Separate from Exercise Library but same visual style

**Daily Recommendation Generator:**
- Pulls today's workout from workout_plans → generates 5–8 dynamic warmup stretches for muscles being trained + 6–10 static cooldown stretches for muscles just worked
- Rest days: full-body mobility flow
- No workout planned: recovery-focused based on yesterday's session
- Sore spots from check-in: add targeted recovery stretches for those areas
- Chronic pain flags (from biggest_obstacles or new `chronic_issues` field in goals_profiles): always included in every session until user marks resolved
- User can add or remove stretches from the generated list before marking done

**Simple Logging:**
- Checkmarks: pre-workout stretches ✓, post-workout stretches ✓, standalone session ✓
- Time of day: morning / pre-workout / post-workout / evening / before bed
- New `stretch_logs` table: user_id, date, stretch_ids TEXT[], session_type, notes, created_at; RLS user-scoped
- No "start stretching" session required — just check off what you did

**Recovery Score Impact:**
- Post-workout static stretching: +5 pts
- Full standalone mobility session on a rest day: +8 pts
- Pre-workout dynamic warmup: +3 pts

**Soreness Tracking in Daily Check-In:**
- New chip selector in daily check-in: sore spots (Neck / Shoulders / Chest / Upper Back / Lower Back / Arms / Core / Hips / Quads / Hamstrings / Calves)
- Acute soreness (marked today after yesterday's workout) → stretch generator adds targeted recovery stretches for those areas
- Follow-up the next day: "Yesterday you marked your [arms] as sore. How are they feeling? Better / Same / Worse" → generator escalates recovery focus if worse
- Chronic pain (marked in biggest_obstacles, e.g. "lower back and hip pain") persists in profile — generator always includes those areas; Smart Check-In asks "Is your lower back still bothering you?" every ~2 weeks (not more often — not nagging)

**DB tables needed:**
- `stretch_logs`: user_id, date, stretch_ids TEXT[], session_type TEXT, notes TEXT, created_at; RLS user-scoped
- `stretches`: id, name, muscle_group, stretch_type (dynamic/static/both), how_to TEXT, common_mistakes TEXT, contraindications TEXT, duration_seconds INT, gif_url; shared table, no RLS needed
- Add `sore_spots TEXT[]` column to `daily_checkins`
- Reset row in Settings for stretch log history

## Vercel Deployment — When Ready

**Steps:**
1. Connect GitHub repo to Vercel (Import Project → select `cert-study-app`)
2. Set framework preset to **Next.js**
3. Add all environment variables:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (secret, never public)
   - `OWNER_PIN_HASH` (SHA-256 hex hash of owner PIN)
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (from Supabase → Settings → API → service_role)
   - `GOOGLE_HEALTH_CLIENT_ID`
   - `GOOGLE_HEALTH_CLIENT_SECRET`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` (the Vercel production URL)
4. Deploy and verify all features work on the live URL
5. Update Google OAuth redirect URIs in Google Cloud Console to include the Vercel URL

**Post-deploy Supabase config (requires live URL):**
- Auth → URL Configuration → add `https://yourdomain.com/update-password` to Redirect URLs
- Auth → URL Configuration → set Site URL to Vercel production URL

**Features that must be tested on Vercel (cannot test locally):**
- `/update-password` — password reset email flow
- Google Health OAuth — full connect/disconnect
- Owner admin "Send Password Reset" — sends real email

**Features that must be built AFTER Vercel deploy:**
- Vercel Cron Job (health auto-sync) — Vercel-only, configured in `vercel.json`
- PWA conversion — service workers require HTTPS
- Barcode scanner — camera API requires HTTPS in most browsers

## Phase Log

### Phase 51 — Pre/Post Workout Meal Advisor + gain_weight Goal + Supplement Adherence — Complete
- **Pre/Post Workout Meal Advisor**: two dismissible banners on Food Log tab — post-workout (blue, shows minutes since completion, protein target + 30-50g carbs, "Log Snack" CTA, visible for 2 hrs after workout finish); pre-workout (blue, shows planned workout label, timing tip, visible all day until workout logged); `workout_logs` query updated to include `created_at`; `workoutFinishedAt` state added
- **gain_weight Goal Option**: added `{ key: 'gain_weight', label: 'Gain Weight / Bulk Up', ... }` to GOALS array in setup page; `calcGoalAdjustment` now handles `gain_weight` — timeline-based surplus (200–500 cal, capped at 500, min 200) or standard 350 cal/day surplus; modes: `gain_timeline` and `gain_standard`; modeExplanation dict updated with gain entries; Timeline card has gain variant framing (scale going up is the goal, Week 1-2 glycogen note, Week 3+ steady gain, "gaining too fast" warning); Scale Expectations card gain variant (different labels/text); gain works alongside build_muscle
- **Supplement Adherence Tracking**: new `supplement_logs` table (user_id, supplement_id, date, taken_at; UNIQUE on user+supp+date; RLS); `loadStack()` now fetches 30-day logs in parallel — derives `todayLogs` Set and `adherence` map (days taken/30); "✓ Taken Today" / "○ Mark Taken" toggle button per supplement card (green border + color when taken); adherence % chip on each card (green ≥70%, yellow ≥40%, grey otherwise); "✓ Mark All as Taken Today" bulk button appears when ≥2 supplements untaken; `handleMarkTaken` upserts/deletes with optimistic UI; reset route + Settings page reset row added

### Phase 50 — Dietary Preferences Wired Downstream — Complete
- Added `DIETARY_RULES` object and `getDietaryWarnings(food, prefs)` function to `nutrition/page.js` — keyword-based checks for vegan, vegetarian, gluten_free, dairy_free, low_sodium, keto, low_carb
- Warning chips (amber) appear on food search results, saved favorites, and My Favorites list in `AddFoodModal` and `SearchModal` when food name/brand matches a restriction keyword
- `AddFoodModal` and `SearchModal` accept `dietaryPrefs` prop; call sites pass `goals?.dietary_preferences || []`
- Meal plan page: added `getMealPlanWarnings` inline function; search results show amber warning chips when food conflicts with stored dietary preferences; `goals_profiles` select expanded to include `dietary_preferences`
- Encyclopedia: API route now returns `dietary_preferences` from `goals_profiles`; new "Vegan/Vegetarian Nutrient Watch List" panel renders above Low Energy banner when vegan/vegetarian pref detected — 6 at-risk nutrients (vegan) or 3 (vegetarian) with clickable buttons opening detail panel; panel always visible, not gated on log days

### Body Measurements — Intelligence Card + Goal Completion + Navy BF% — Complete
- Added `calcNavyBfPct(entry, heightInches, sex)` using the U.S. Navy Method — accurate BF% from tape measurements (waist/neck/hips + height); shown as a badge on every history entry where neck + waist measurements are logged
- Added `interpretBodyComp(current, previous, goalsProfile, supplements, recentCarbAvg)` — context-aware body composition signal card after each save
- Signal card analyzes weight delta vs measurement deltas (waist, arms, thighs) and classifies into 7 modes: muscle_gain, scale_noise, fat_loss, recomp, fat_gain, fat_loss_highbf, check_protein
- Context modifiers: (1) Creatine — if creatine is in supplement_stack, notes that missed doses cause water deflation without tissue loss; (2) Low carb — if 14-day avg carbs < 90g/day, notes glycogen depletion flattens muscles; (3) Navy BF% > threshold — when body fat is high (>25% male, >33% female), losing size everywhere is overwhelmingly fat not muscle — reduces false alarm signals
- `getGoalCompletion(hist, gp)` — checks latest weight vs target_weight_lbs; returns 'reached' (within 0.5 lbs), 'almost' (≤ 3 lbs over), or null
- Goal completion banner at top of page with 3 action paths: "Switch to Maintenance" (removes lose_weight), "Shift to Body Recomp" (adds lose_weight + build_muscle), "Set New Goal" (redirects to setup)
- `loadAll()` now fetches 4 things in parallel: measurements, goals_profiles (full row), supplement_stack, and food_log_entries for 14-day carb average

### Goals Setup + Nutrition — Timeline-Aware Calorie Target + Body Recomp — Complete
- Added `calcGoalAdjustment(goals, weightLbs, targetWeightLbs, timeline)` to `src/lib/tdee.js` — now exported and shared
- When target_weight_lbs + timeline both provided for lose_weight: calculates exact daily deficit from (lbs to lose × 3500) ÷ timeline days; capped 150–1,000 cal/day with explanation when adjusted
- Body recomposition mode: lose_weight + build_muscle selected simultaneously → 250 cal/day deficit with high-protein framing (not 500 cal pure cut)
- "No target weight" fallback: still defaults to 500 cal/day deficit with a note explaining how to get a personalized number
- Step 4 now shows: personalized eating target with math breakdown (TDEE ± X = target); projection badge (e.g. "Lose 6 lbs in 6 months"); ⚠ safety cap badge when timeline was too aggressive; explanation card per mode
- Nutrition page: now imports `calcGoalAdjustment` from shared lib; uses goals.weight_lbs + goals.target_weight_lbs + goals.timeline to compute the same adjustment; label shows ⚡ for recomp, 🔥 for deficit, 💪 for surplus

### Goals Setup + Nutrition — Eating Target vs Maintenance Clarification — Complete
- Goals setup Step 4 now shows two distinct numbers: "Eating Target" (goal-adjusted) as the primary large number with goal-colored border, and TDEE (maintenance) as a smaller secondary figure labeled "maintenance"
- Eating target formula: lose_weight = TDEE − 500, build_muscle = TDEE + 200, maintain/other = TDEE
- For weight loss/muscle: shows the deficit/surplus math inline (TDEE ± X = eating target), plus a brief explanation of WHY that specific number (1 lb/week fat loss pace; lean bulk with minimal fat gain)
- Projection badge shown: "~1 lb / week fat loss" or "~0.5 lb / week lean gain" or "Weight maintenance"
- Nutrition page calorie ring updated: `effectiveTarget` now applies the same goal adjustment before adding workout bonus; "Target" label updated to "Eating Target 🔥" (lose) or "Eating Target 💪" (build); a secondary line shows "Maintenance (TDEE)" when a deficit/surplus is active so user can see both numbers

### Heart Rate Phase 4 — 5-Minute Line Chart + RHR/HRV Fix — Complete
- Created `health_heart_rate_5min` table (user_id, date, minute_bucket SMALLINT, avg/min/max_bpm, sample_count; UNIQUE on user_id+date+minute_bucket; RLS enabled)
- Updated `sync/route.js`: added 5-minute bucketing alongside existing hourly; `minuteBucket = estHour*60 + floor(estMin/5)*5`; upserts to `health_heart_rate_5min` after hourly upsert
- Updated `workout-hr-sync/route.js`: same 5-minute bucketing added for live workout HR polling
- Updated `heart-rate/route.js`: added `fiveMinRes` query from `health_heart_rate_5min`; fixed RHR/HRV cards showing "—" — now falls back to `yesterdayDaily` when today has no resting data (Google stores resting HR under the sleep date, which is often yesterday); `workoutWindow` now exposes `startMinute`/`endMinute` in addition to hour fields; `fiveMin` included in response
- Rebuilt `heart-rate/page.js`: replaced 24-bar chart with SVG line graph using 5-minute data points; line colored segment-by-segment by BPM zone; min/max shaded band behind line; hover on SVG finds closest data point and shows tooltip with time (e.g. "2:30p") + BPM + range; workout window drawn as a shaded red band; falls back to hourly intraday if 5-min table is empty (existing users before re-sync); X-axis labeled every 3 hours; Y-axis auto-scales to data range

### Heart Rate Phase 3 — Workout Zone Breakdown — Complete
- Added `computeHrZones(supabase, userId, logId, durationSeconds)` in `/api/workouts/log/route.js`:
  - Computes workout start/end from `Date.now()` and `duration_seconds`
  - Fetches `health_heart_rate_intraday` rows for the workout date filtered to start/end hours
  - Fetches `goals_profiles.age` to compute max HR (220 - age; default 35 if not set)
  - Zones: Fat Burn 60-70%, Cardio 70-80%, Hard 80-90%, Peak 90%+
  - Minutes estimated from `sample_count / 6` (~10s per sample)
  - Writes result to `workout_logs.hr_zones` JSONB; returns `null` silently if no intraday data
- POST and PATCH handlers now run `computeHrZones` in `Promise.all` alongside overload detection; `hrZones` included in response
- Completion screen: new HR Zones card renders when `done.hrZones` has any non-zero zone minutes — proportional colored bar + legend with minutes per zone + avg/max bpm header; gracefully absent when Google Health not connected or no HR data for the session
- History page: expanded session rows now show HR zones bar + legend when `log.hr_zones` exists — automatically populated for any future workout; historical sessions without data show nothing (no empty state)

### Heart Rate Phase 1 + 2 — Complete
- Created `/api/health/heart-rate/route.js` (GET): returns `intraday` (hourly avg/min/max_bpm for requested date), `daily` (7-day resting HR + HRV trend), `workoutWindow` (start/end hour from today's workout_logs, if any), `todayAvg`, `todayResting`, `todayHrv`
- Created `/life-hub/health/heart-rate/page.js`:
  - Top cards: Avg Today (color-coded by zone), Resting HR, HRV (RMSSD)
  - 24-hour bar chart: 24 slots (one per hour), bars colored by BPM zone (blue=resting/blue, green=light, amber=moderate, yellow=hard, red=peak); workout window bars highlighted red with legend annotation; future-hours shown as faded grey; hover tooltip shows avg/min/max + zone + workout flag
  - 7-day resting HR trend: SVG polyline with labeled dots, today's dot filled larger, grid lines, day labels — only shown when ≥2 days of resting data exist
  - HRV panel: current value + context paragraph + 4 zone chips (< 20ms / 20–40 / 40–60 / 60ms+) with active chip highlighted
- Upgraded `/life-hub/health/page.js` (Health Overview):
  - Primary stat cards (Steps, Avg HR, Sleep) are now clickable Links to their sub-pages with "View details →" hint
  - Added second row: Resting HR card, HRV card, Sleep Score card (all linked to sub-pages; sleep score color-coded by tier)
  - Removed "more data coming soon" placeholder
  - Refresh now also re-fetches heart-rate endpoint in parallel
- Added "Heart Rate" link to LifeHubSidebar Health dropdown (between Step Tracker and Sleep Tracker)

### Sleep Tracker Upgrade — Complete
- Added `ScoreRing` SVG component: animated progress ring (0–100), color-coded (green ≥80 / blue ≥65 / yellow ≥50 / red <50), shows score and label (Excellent/Good/Fair/Poor)
- New top card combines score ring + quality metrics grid: Total Sleep, Sleep Onset (with green/yellow threshold at 20m), Efficiency (threshold at 85%), Awakenings (threshold at 3), Restlessness label (Restful/Normal/Restless/Very Restless) — all pulled from new sync route fields (sleepScore, sleepOnset, sleepEfficiency, sleepAwakeCount, sleepRestlessness)
- Stage summary cards (Deep/REM/Light/Awake) now show percentage of total sleep + target range below the minute count
- Added `STAGE_EDUCATION` constant with 4 detailed education cards (collapsible) explaining Deep/REM/Light/Awake:
  - Each card: target %, plain-language description of what's happening, bulleted body processes, "If you're low" warning callout
  - Deep: muscle repair, immune cells, brain waste flushing
  - REM: memory consolidation, emotion processing, creativity, motor skills
  - Light: sleep spindles, bridge role, why it still matters
  - Awake: normal awakening count ranges, temperature/alcohol/consistency tips
- Cards expand on click, auto-annotate with your actual minutes + percentage for the stage
- All new data (`sleepScore`, `sleepOnset`, etc.) was already being written by the sync route from Phase 0 — purely a UI update, no API changes

### Edit Saved Favorites — Complete
- Added `foodCompleteness(food)` helper (module-level): returns `'complete'` (all 4 macros + ≥6 tracked micros), `'partial'` (all macros, few micros), or `'minimal'` (missing a core macro)
- Added `CORE_MACRO_KEYS` and `TRACKED_MICRO_KEYS` constants at module level (19 micro fields tracked)
- Added `EditFoodModal` component: full-screen modal with all 27 nutrition fields pre-populated from saved food; grouped sections (Macros, Fats & Cholesterol, Minerals, Vitamins, Other); 🤖 Fill N missing button calls `/api/nutrition/ai-micro-fill` and highlights AI-estimated fields in yellow; Save Changes calls `PUT /api/nutrition/my-foods` (already existed); AI-filled fields can be individually edited; closing clears the modal
- Modified `SavedFoodsTab`: added `onEdit` prop; added ✏️ button to each FoodRow (calls `onEdit(food)`); added completeness chip (✓/⚠/✗) to each food name row with tooltip explaining the status; added completeness summary header ("X complete · Y partial · Z minimal") below subtitle when foods exist; updated subtitle hint text to include "✏️ to edit"
- Added `editingFood` state and `handleEditMyFood` handler to `NutritionPage`; handler updates `myFoods` in-place and closes modal
- Rendered `EditFoodModal` in `NutritionPage` return when `editingFood` is set
- Wired `onEdit={setEditingFood}` onto `SavedFoodsTab` call site

- Added `hr_zones JSONB` column to `workout_logs`
- Added sleep quality columns to `health_sleep_sessions`: onset_minutes, efficiency_pct, awake_count, longest_stretch_min, restlessness TEXT, sleep_score SMALLINT
- Extracted `refreshTokenIfNeeded`, `fetchDataType`, `estDateStr`, `getEstHour`, `computeSleepMetrics`, `computeSleepScore` to `src/lib/googleHealth.js` (shared by sync and workout-hr-sync routes)
- Updated `sync/route.js`: imports from shared lib; dual-buckets HR samples by both date (daily) and date+hour (intraday); adds `daily-resting-heart-rate` and `daily-heart-rate-variability` fetches (defensive field name handling); computes and stores all sleep quality metrics on every sleep session upsert
- Created `src/app/api/health/workout-hr-sync/route.js`: lightweight POST, fetches last 2 hours of HR only, upserts intraday rows — called every 90s during active workouts
- Updated workout log page (`src/app/life-hub/workouts/log/page.js`): checks `/api/health/status` on load; starts 90s HR polling interval when `running=true` and `healthConnected=true`; stops polling on finish; fires one final sync call before showing post-workout modal
- **No user-visible changes** — data now accumulates in background

- **Empty meal slot state** — replaced "Nothing logged yet." text with a dashed "+ Log breakfast…" button that opens the food modal directly
- Nutrition page `load()` now fetches yesterday's log entries + today's water from `water_logs` in parallel

### Phase B: Age-Adjusted Micronutrient Targets + Teen Safety Gates - Complete
- **`calcMicroTargets(age, sex)`** added to `src/lib/tdee.js` — returns NIH DRI-sourced per-nutrient daily targets keyed by DB column name (calcium_mg, vitamin_d_mcg, iron_mg, magnesium_mg, etc.) + `b12AbsorptionFlag` true when age ≥ 50

- **Stale pause cleanup** — auto-cleared if paused workout is from previous day

### Fix: Saved drink delete not persisting (hydration page)
- **Problem:** Deleting a drink from "MY DRINKS" appeared to work but came back after switching pages; the DB delete was silently failing due to a FK constraint (`food_log_entries.my_food_id` → `my_foods.id`)
- **Fix:** `DELETE /api/nutrition/my-foods` now nulls out `food_log_entries.my_food_id` first, then deletes; returns a real error on failure; client only removes from state if `res.ok`

### Phase 52 - Complete
- **AI Supplement Fill** — "🤖 AI Fill" button in the add supplement form
- Type a supplement name → click 🤖 AI Fill → Haiku returns dose, timing, and nutrients; pre-fills form fields; user reviews and adjusts before saving

- **Owner Admin Panel** — user list; Enable/Disable, Force Logout, Send Password Reset, Clear PIN per user
- **Brute force protection on /join** — `join_attempts` table + `check_join_rate_limit` Postgres function; 5 failed attempts per IP per hour → 429

### Phase 41 (earlier) - Complete
- **Account deletion** — Danger Zone; confirmation requires typing "DELETE"; `/api/delete-account` wipes all data + removes auth user
- **Privacy PIN** — optional Settings lock; bcrypt hash in `profiles.settings_pin_hash`; full-page PIN gate; Set/Change/Remove modals

### Phase 40 (earlier) - Complete
