# Cert Study App - Build Notes

## Project Overview
A personal command center combining a study platform for CCNA, CompTIA Network+, 
and Security+ certifications with a life tracking hub for health, nutrition, and wellness.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js 16.2.7 (App Router, `src/` directory, Turbopack)
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + RLS)
- **AI:** Anthropic Claude API (`claude-sonnet-4-6`)
- **Hosting:** Vercel
- **Version Control:** GitHub
- **Styling:** Inline styles only — no Tailwind classes in JSX (switched during build)

## Architecture
Three section approach:
- **Home Page** — morning brief snapshot, two door navigation into Study Hub and Life Hub, insights and patterns section
- **Study Hub** — all cert studying features
- **Life Hub** — health, fitness, and nutrition tracking
- **Correlation Engine** — AI powered insights connecting both hubs

- Private GitHub repository
- Environment variables stored in .env.local and Vercel dashboard
- Agent features built in Phase 8 and beyond once data infrastructure is in place
- PWA conversion after core features are built

## Security Plan
- Login and signup via Supabase Auth
- Two factor authentication
- Row Level Security on all Supabase tables
- Private GitHub repository
- API keys in .env.local — never committed to GitHub
- Vercel password protection on live URL
- All user data siloed by user ID

## App Delivery
- Progressive Web App (PWA) after core features are built
- Add to Home Screen support for iOS and Android
- Full screen native app feel on mobile
- Barcode scanning via phone camera works natively in PWA
- Desktop browser experience remains completely unchanged

## Passive Learning Note
Building this app is actively reinforcing cert concepts:
- API communication = client server architecture
- Supabase = database structure, access control, RLS
- GitHub = version control, change management
- Security decisions = CIA triad, least privilege, access control
- Vercel/CDN/SSL = cloud concepts directly on exam

## Active Branch
`claude/adoring-shannon-sTxW8`

## Session Rules
- **After every commit/push:** give the user the pull command in a code block:
  ```
  git pull origin claude/adoring-shannon-sTxW8
  ```
- **Update both CLAUDE.md and build-notes.md** before every push — not just at end of session. If a feature was added, a section changed, or a new file created, the notes must reflect it in that same commit.
- **After every change or fix, provide a brief summary covering:**
  1. What the problem was (or what was requested)
  2. What was changed (files/logic updated)
  3. What to test to confirm it works correctly

## Database Tables
| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `question_answers` | Every answered question — cert, topic, correct flag, timestamp |
| `topic_performance` | Aggregated accuracy per cert+topic — drives spaced repetition and weak domain features |
| `test_sessions` | Completed test records — cert, mode, score_pct, correct, total_questions, duration_seconds, completed_at |
| `paused_tests` | In-progress tests saved as JSON with full state for resume |
| `question_templates` | Template library with variable_sets and is_retired flag |
| `bookmarked_questions` | Bookmarks with reason, notes, and full question snapshot |
| `flagged_questions` | User-reported question issues |
| `profiles` | User display name |
| `lab_progress` | Completed lab steps per user (user_id, lab_set_id, lab_id, step_id, completed_at) |
| `lab_notes` | Per-lab freeform notes per user (user_id, lab_set_id, lab_id, notes, updated_at) |
| `flashcards` | Generated flashcard decks — saved permanently per cert |
| `flashcard_progress` | Per-card mastery state: mastered flag, consecutive_correct count |
| `lab_timers` | Per-lab timer state — elapsed_seconds, is_running, last_started_at; unique per user+lab |

### Phase 21 - Complete
Mark as Learned, Lab Completion Summary, and AI Doc Feedback:

**Mark as Learned**
- `learned_at TIMESTAMPTZ` column added to `question_answers`
- Wrong-answers API now filters out rows where `learned_at IS NOT NULL`; includes `id` in returned question objects as `_wrongAnswerId`
- PATCH /api/wrong-answers sets learned_at on the given row
- When answer is revealed in practice mode and question has `_wrongAnswerId`, a purple "✓ Mark as Learned" button appears
- One click marks it — button turns green and is disabled; question won't appear in future Wrong Answer Reviews

**Lab Completion Summary**
- "Complete Lab — Get Summary" button at bottom of every lab page
- Only enabled when: all steps are checked complete AND every step with a document array has non-empty localStorage docs
- Button shows specific reason if not yet enabled ("mark all steps done" or "save documentation for all steps" first)
- On click: calls POST /api/lab-summary with lab title, description, all steps, user's documentation per step, and notes
- Returns AI summary with three sections: What You Built, Key Concepts Practiced, Keep Practicing
- Shown in a modal with markdown-style rendering; Close, Next Lab →, or View Lab Set buttons
- Old "Complete Set" nav button replaced with "← Back to Lab Set" — the new Complete Lab button handles that flow

**AI Documentation Feedback**
- On Save in the DOCUMENT YOUR WORK textarea: calls POST /api/lab-doc-feedback
- Sends step title, step content, document prompts, and user text to Claude
- Returns 1-3 sentences of specific, actionable feedback shown inline below the textarea with a 🤖 icon
- Save button shows "Analyzing..." while waiting; onBlur no longer triggers save (explicit save only)

### Phase 20 - Complete
Wrong Answer Review + Per-Lab Timer:

**Wrong Answer Review**
- `question_snapshot` JSONB column added to `question_answers` (nullable, only populated for incorrect answers)
- Snapshot contains: question, options, correct letter, topic, explanations
- New API route `/api/wrong-answers?cert=X` — fetches wrong answer snapshots, dedupes by question text, returns array
- "🔁 Wrong Answer Review" card on Take a Test setup — cert selector, live count of saved wrong answers, Start Review button
- Loads directly as a practice session (tutor chat, bookmarks, explanations all active)
- Runs as mode='practice' so all existing practice UI and stats tracking work unchanged

**Per-Lab Timer**
- New `lab_timers` Supabase table with RLS — unique per user+lab, stores elapsed_seconds + is_running + last_started_at
- `LabTimer.js` component in lab page header — Start / Pause / Reset controls, HH:MM:SS display
- Timer is persistent: on load recalculates elapsed using last_started_at so closing the tab mid-run loses no time
- Green border + color when running, normal when paused

### Phase 19c - Complete
Lab data quality audit — empty verify fields and topology build clarity:

**Empty verify fields fixed**
- CCNA Fundamentals Lab 3 Step 1: added verify command (show interfaces status on SW2)
- Small Office Network Lab 1 Step 1: added verify command (show interfaces status on SW1 confirming all 6 ports connected)
- Small Office Network Lab 5 Step 1: added verify command (show interfaces status on DSW confirming all 5 uplinks)

**Security+ lab improvements**
- All four lab topologies now include device model sublabels (Cisco 1841 router, Catalyst 2960 switch)
- Lab 1, 2, 3, and 4 Step 1 now includes explicit topology build instructions before any CLI work — user is told exactly which devices to add, how to connect them, and what IPs to pre-assign so they have a clear starting point

### Phase 19b - Complete
Bug fixes and lab improvements:

**Topology rendering (LabTopology.js)**
- Accepts both old format (`connections` with `fromLabel`/`toLabel`) and new format (`links` with single `label` split on `\n`)
- Auto-computes `viewBox` from node positions when not provided — new lab files no longer need to define it
- Node `label` with `\n` now correctly splits into main label + sublabel; old `sublabel` field still works
- All Network+ and Security+ lab topologies now render fully with connections

**Lab set overview — domain strength indicators**
- Domain tags now show accuracy % and color-coded strength: ▼ red = weak (<65%), ◆ yellow = avg (65–80%), ▲ green = strong (≥80%)
- Red border + "🎯 Needs Practice" badge when any domain is weak
- "No test data yet" shown in italic when topic_performance has no data for that cert
- Threshold lowered from 5 to 3 questions seen

**Flashcard weak domain section**
- Always visible now — shows "take some practice tests" message when no data (was hidden entirely)
- Threshold lowered from 5 to 3 questions seen

**Network+ Lab 4 rewrite (Troubleshooting Methodology)**
- Previous version was vague about how to build the network and didn't give explicit break instructions
- Rewritten as 7 explicit steps: place & cable all devices → configure IPs → verify baseline → Fault 1 (shutdown interface) → Fault 2 (wrong subnet mask) → Fault 3 (missing gateway) → write incident reports
- Each fault step has an explicit INTRODUCE section (exact what to change), DIAGNOSE section (which commands and what to look for), and FIX section
